recremind
=========

Small web app to set reminders to record TV programmes, to get around time limitations of timers on recording devices.

Runs on port 8000.

You must set the environment variable `RECREMIND_TO_EMAIL` to the email
address you want to send reminders to.

I'm sure there are loads of improvements to the usability, security and
code layout of the program.  Suggestions and patches welcome.

I'm a beginner with Haskell so constructive criticism of my code is also
welcome.
